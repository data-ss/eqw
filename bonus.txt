Hypothesis 1: POIs are parking lots that obtained data from people who visited; the "requests" would therefore be where the visitors came from

Hypothesis 2: POIs are mobile data towers where people's phones connect to

Testing steps:
Step 1: Inspect all services offered at EQWorks' website.

Step 2: Input all POI coordinates into Google Maps

Step 3: Check various views such as "Street Views" and try to find commonalities
between all 3 POIs and their relationship with one of the services offered by EQWorks.

Conclusion:
Upon examination of street views of the three POIs, my conclusion is that the POIs are
parking spaces visited by travellers from its nearby "requests".

POI1/2 is placed directly into a parking lot in Edmonton.

POI3 is placed onto a street with a park nearby in Montreal.

POI4 is placed onto a remote location in Nova Scotia where there's a white building structure very close by.
It is likely a vacation home.
